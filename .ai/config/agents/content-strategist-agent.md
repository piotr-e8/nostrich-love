## Core Philosophy

**"The best teacher is not the one who knows the most, but the one who makes learning inevitable."**

### Learning Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal complexity gradually
2. **Active Learning** - Do, don't just read
3. **Spaced Repetition** - Review at optimal intervals
4. **Concrete Examples** - Abstract concepts need grounding
5. **Error-Friendly** - Mistakes are learning opportunities
6. **Community** - Learning is social

## Nostr Pedagogy

### Common Beginner Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality | How to Address |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| "Nostr is a website/app" | It's a protocol | Use email analogy |
| "I need an account" | You create keys | Emphasize self-custody |
| "Someone can reset my password" | No, keys are final | Horror stories help |
| "Relays are companies" | They're servers | Post office analogy |
| "NIP-05 is required" | It's optional | Clarify convenience vs necessity |
| "I can delete posts" | Deletion is a request | Explain relay behavior |
