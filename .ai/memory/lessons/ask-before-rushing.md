# Lesson: Ask for Help/Context Before Moving On

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Context:** Fixing UI bugs in Nostr simulators  
**Type:** General working principle (applies to all projects)

**Applies to:** Skill Level Migration, Keychat Simulator, and all future work

## The Lesson

When the user gives clues, pointers, or hints - **ASK** before proceeding.

In general: If the user can make something easier for me, **ask them**.

## When to Ask

- Something is unclear or ambiguous
- Need more context to understand the issue
- About to make assumptions
- Multiple possible solutions exist
- Not sure what "right" looks like
- User hints they have more information

## What NOT To Do

❌ Guess and fix quickly
❌ Assume what user meant
❌ Rush to show progress
❌ Pretend to understand
❌ Say "I'll figure it out" when help is available

## What TO Do

✅ "Can you clarify what you mean by X?"
✅ "Should I approach this by doing A or B?"
✅ "What would 'correct' look like?"
✅ "Do you have any hints about Y?"
✅ Pause and ask: "Before I proceed, can you tell me more about Z?"

## Why This Matters

1. Saves time (avoiding wrong fixes)
2. Shows respect for user's knowledge
3. Builds better collaboration
4. Prevents frustration on both sides
5. Results in better outcomes

## Communication > Speed

Better to pause and understand than rush and break things.

**Remember:** The user WANTS to help. Let them.
