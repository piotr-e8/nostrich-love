## What are Zaps? ⚡

Zaps are Bitcoin tips sent over the Lightning Network. They're the native value layer of Nostr—allowing users to reward content they love with real money.

Think of them as "likes with value"—a way to support people whose content you enjoy.

### How Zaps Work

1. **You create good content** → A post, thread, or reply
2. **Someone enjoys it** → They click the ⚡ zap button
3. **They send satoshis** → Tiny amounts of Bitcoin (1000 sats = ~$0.30)
4. **You receive instantly** → Money appears in your wallet
5. **Everyone sees it** → Zaps are public and create social proof

### Why Zaps Are Revolutionary

**Traditional Social Media:**

- Likes are free and worthless
- Platform keeps all ad revenue
- Creators get nothing
- Engagement is hollow

**Nostr with Zaps:**

- Every like can have real value
- No platform takes a cut
- Direct creator support
- Meaningful engagement

### Real Examples

- Developer receives 100,000 sats ($30) for fixing a bug
- Artist gets zapped for sharing their work
- Writer earns Bitcoin for insightful threads
- Meme creator gets tips for viral content

### The Value-for-Value Model

```
Traditional Social Media:              Nostr:
┌──────────────────┐                 ┌──────────────────┐
│ Free to post     │                 │ Free to post     │
│ Free to read     │                 │ Free to read     │
│ Attention = $$$  │                 │ Attention = ⚡   │
│ (for platform)   │                 │ (for creator)    │
└──────────────────┘                 └──────────────────┘
```

### How Zaps Appear

In supported clients, zaps show up as:

- ⚡ Lightning bolt icons
- Amount zapped (e.g., "21 sats")
- Running totals on posts
- Special notifications when you receive them

```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Alice                              │
│ "Just published my new article!"   │
│                                    │
│ [❤️ 12] [💬 3] [⚡ 5,420 sats]     │
│                                    │
│ ⚡ Bob zapped 1,000 sats           │
│ ⚡ Carol zapped 500 sats           │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Not Required!

> 💡 **Important**: Zaps are completely optional. You can use Nostr for free forever without ever sending or receiving a single satoshi.

## Sending Zaps 💸

### How to Zap a Post

1. **Find a post you like**
2. **Tap the ⚡ button**
3. **Choose amount** or enter custom
4. **Add message** (optional)
5. **Confirm** and send!

### Zap Amounts Etiquette

**Quick reference:**

| Amount           | When to Use                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 10-50 sats       | Small appreciation             |
| 100-500 sats     | Good post/thread               |
| 1,000-5,000 sats | Great content, podcast episode |
| 10,000+ sats     | Exceptional value, art, tool   |

> 💡 **Rule of thumb**: Zap what the content is worth to you. No amount is too small!

### Custom Messages

Most clients let you add a message with your zap:

```
"Thanks for the help!"
"Great thread, learned a lot"
"☕ Coffee's on me"
```

This personalizes the interaction and helps creators know what content resonates.

## Receiving Zaps 💰

### Setting Up LNURL

To receive zaps, you need to configure where they go:

1. **Get your Lightning Address or LNURL**
   - From your wallet (Alby, Phoenix, etc.)
   - Format: `yourname@provider.com`

2. **Add to Your Profile**

   ```
   Client → Profile → Edit → Lightning Address
   Paste: yourname@getalby.com
   ```

3. **Verify it works**
   - Ask a friend to send you 10 sats
   - Or use a testnet faucet

### Zap Notifications

**In most clients:**

- Push notification when zapped
- Notification tab shows zap history
- Can see who zapped you

**Privacy note:**
Zaps are semi-public. While amounts can be private in some setups, the fact that you zapped (or were zapped) is visible.

## Zap Splits [ADVANCED]

<Note type="advanced">
  Optional feature for sharing zap revenue automatically.
</Note>

### What are Zap Splits?

When someone zaps your post, automatically split the payment with collaborators:

```
Example: Podcast Episode
├── 70% → Host (you)
├── 20% → Producer
└── 10% → Editor
```

### Setting Up Splits

1. **In your client**: Look for "Zap Splits" or "Recipients"
2. **Add collaborators**: Enter their Lightning addresses
3. **Set percentages**: Must total 100%
4. **Save**: Future zaps auto-split

### Common Use Cases

- **Podcasts**: Split between host and guests
- **Collaborative posts**: Share with co-authors
- **Art**: Split with inspiration sources
- **Open source**: Fund dependencies
