## Threat Model (3 minutes)

### What Are You Protecting Against?

Before diving into security practices, let's understand what threats exist on Nostr:

**Threat Level 1: Casual Privacy**

- **Concern:** Don't want employers/family seeing everything
- **Threats:** Public posts, profile association
- **Solution:** Separate identities

**Threat Level 2: Active Avoidance**

- **Concern:** Avoiding specific people/platforms
- **Threats:** Doxxing, harassment, stalking
- **Solution:** Anonymous account, OPSEC

**Threat Level 3: High Security**

- **Concern:** Whistleblowers, activists, high-profile individuals
- **Threats:** State actors, sophisticated attacks
- **Solution:** Advanced OPSEC, air-gapped keys

### What Nostr Protects

✅ **Censorship Resistance**

- No platform can ban you
- Your identity can't be seized
- Posts distributed across network

✅ **Data Ownership**

- You control your keys
- Portable across clients
- No company owns your graph

### What Nostr Doesn't Protect

❌ **Public By Default**

- All posts are public (unless encrypted DMs)
- Metadata leaks possible
- Content analysis possible

❌ **No Anonymity Guarantees**

- Your npub is pseudonymous, not anonymous
- Patterns can reveal identity
- IP addresses visible to relays

<Callout type="info">
  **Realistic expectations:** Nostr provides censorship resistance, not perfect
  anonymity. Understand the difference.
</Callout>

## Identity Separation (3 minutes)

### Why Multiple Identities?

Most people should have **at least two** Nostr identities:

**1. Public Identity**

- Linked to real name
- Professional use
- Public figure presence
- Long-term reputation

**2. Private/Pseudonymous Identity**

- Not linked to real name
- Personal interests
- Controversial opinions
- Testing/experimentation

### When to Separate

**Definitely separate:**

- Personal vs professional life
- Different interests (work, hobbies, politics)
- Testing new clients/apps
- Financial (tipping) vs social

**Can combine:**

- Close friends who know everything
- Low-stakes casual use
- Already public persona

### Managing Multiple Keys

**Option 1: Different Clients**

- Use Damus for public identity
- Use Amethyst for private identity
- Simple, but limited to device

**Option 2: Nostr Signer Apps**

- Use Amber (Android) or similar
- Multiple keys in one app
- More flexible

**Option 3: Separate Devices**

- Phone for public
- Tablet for private
- Maximum isolation

<Callout type="tip">
  **Start simple:** Create one pseudonymous account first. Add a public one
  later if needed.
</Callout>

## Signer Apps (3 minutes)

### What Are Signers?

**Signer apps** store your private keys securely and sign messages for other apps.

**How it works:**

1. Signer app holds your nsec
2. Client app requests "sign this message"
3. Signer app approves and signs
4. Client app never sees your nsec

### Benefits

✅ **Key Isolation**

- Nsec never leaves signer
- Clients can't steal keys
- Compromised client = safe keys

✅ **Approval Required**

- See what you're signing
- Prevent accidental posts
- Control over actions

✅ **Multiple Clients**

- Use same keys across apps
- Consistent identity
- Easy switching

### Popular Signer Apps

**Amber (Android)**

- Best signer on mobile
- Open source
- Active development
- Supports multiple keys

**Primal (iOS)**

- Built-in secure storage
- No need for separate signer app
- Keys stay on device
- Simple and intuitive

**Other Options:**

- **Nostr Connect** (cross-platform protocol)
- **Browser extensions** (Alby can sign)
- **Hardware wallets** [ADVANCED]

### Setting Up Amber

1. **Download** from Play Store
2. **Create or import** keys
3. **Set as default signer** in Android settings
4. **Open Nostr client** - it will request signing
5. **Approve requests** in Amber

### When to Use Signers

**Highly recommended:**

- Serious Nostr users
- High-value accounts
- Multiple clients
- Security-conscious users

**Not necessary:**

- Casual testing
- Low-value accounts
- Single client use
- Beginners (add later)

<Callout type="warning">
  **Critical:** Your signer app becomes a single point of failure. Back it up
  securely!
</Callout>

## Key Rotation (2 minutes)

### What is Key Rotation?

**Key rotation** means creating new keys and migrating your following to them.

### When to Rotate

**Do rotate:**

- Suspect compromise
- Private key accidentally exposed
- Moving from custodial to self-custodial
- Periodic security practice

**Don't rotate casually:**

- Lose all history
- Confuse followers
- Break NIP-05 connections

### How to Rotate

**Step 1: Prepare**

1. Generate new keys securely
2. Back them up properly
3. Test new account

**Step 2: Announce**

1. Post from old account: "Moving to [new npub]"
2. Pin the post
3. Update bio with new npub
4. Wait a few days

**Step 3: Migrate**

1. Follow your old follows on new account
2. Update NIP-05 if you have one
3. Tell close contacts directly

**Step 4: Sunset**

1. Post from old account periodically: "Moved to [new]"
2. Keep old account as redirect
3. Eventually abandon old account

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro tip:** If you have a NIP-05, you can update it to point to your new
  npub. People using your NIP-05 will automatically follow your new account.
</Callout>

## Metadata Leaks (5 minutes)

### What Metadata Leaks?

Even "anonymous" posts can reveal identity through:

**1. Writing Style**

- Vocabulary choices
- Grammar patterns
- Emoji usage
- Capitalization habits

**2. Content Clues**

- Locations mentioned
- Specific events
- Inside jokes
- Unique knowledge

**3. Timing Patterns**

- When you post (timezone)
- Response times
- Active hours

**4. Technical Leaks**

- IP addresses (visible to relays)
- Client software version
- Device fingerprints

**5. Social Graph**

- Who you follow
- Who follows you
- Interaction patterns

### Prevention Strategies

**1. Separate Writing Styles**

- Use different vocabulary
- Vary sentence structure
- Different emoji habits

**2. Be Vague**

- Don't mention specific dates
- Avoid unique identifiers
- Generalize locations

**3. Use Tor/VPN**

- Hide IP from relays
- Use different IPs per identity
- Consider Tor for maximum privacy

**4. Limit Client Info**

- Some clients leak version info
- Check what your client sends
- Use privacy-focused clients

**5. Control Social Graph**

- Don't follow same people
- Different circles
- Limit cross-identity interactions

### Cross-Identity Contamination

**What NOT to do:**

- ❌ Mention your other account
- ❌ Post same content simultaneously
- ❌ Follow exact same people
- ❌ Use same phrases/slang
- ❌ Respond to same threads
- ❌ Post from both in same conversation

**Safe practices:**

- ✅ Completely separate content
- ✅ Different topics/interests
- ✅ Different active times
- ✅ No cross-references
- ✅ Assume they're watching

<Callout type="warning">
  **Paranoia check:** If you need true anonymity, assume a motivated adversary
  is analyzing everything. Act accordingly.
</Callout>

## OPSEC Checklist (2 minutes)

### Basic Security (Everyone)

- [ ] Back up keys in 3+ places
- [ ] Use password manager
- [ ] Never screenshot keys
- [ ] Never share nsec
- [ ] Keep client software updated
- [ ] Use unique keys per identity

### Enhanced Security (Active Users)

- [ ] Use signer app
- [ ] Separate devices/accounts
- [ ] VPN/Tor for sensitive posts
- [ ] Regular key rotation (yearly)
- [ ] Monitor for impersonators
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

### Maximum Security (High Risk)

- [ ] Air-gapped key generation
- [ ] Hardware security modules
- [ ] Self-hosted relay
- [ ] Tor-only connections
- [ ] Multiple identity layers
- [ ] Regular OPSEC audits
- [ ] Legal consultation

### Audit Yourself

**Questions to ask:**

1. If someone wanted to dox me, what would they find?
2. Are my multiple identities actually separate?
3. What happens if my phone is stolen?
4. Who would I tell if I got compromised?
5. What's my recovery plan?

---

## Recovery Planning (2 minutes)

### If You Suspect Compromise

**Immediate actions:**

1. **Stop posting** from compromised account
2. **Document** what happened
3. **Generate new keys** on secure device
4. **Announce** the compromise (if public)
5. **Rotate** to new keys
6. **Investigate** how it happened

### Building a Recovery Plan

**Before you need it:**

1. **Trusted contacts** - Who can verify your new identity?
2. **Proof of identity** - How will you prove you're you?
3. **Out-of-band communication** - How to reach followers if Nostr is compromised?
4. **NIP-05 control** - Can you update your identifier?
5. **Backup strategy** - How are keys backed up?

### Communication Template

If compromised, post something like:

```
⚠️ SECURITY ALERT ⚠️

My account [old npub] has been compromised.

My new account is: [new npub]

This message is signed by both keys to prove transition.

[Signed message from new key]

Please unfollow the old account and follow this one.
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Hope for the best, plan for the worst.** Having a recovery plan reduces
  panic if something goes wrong.
</Callout>
