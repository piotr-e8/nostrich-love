    href="/follow-pack" 
    className="inline-flex items-center text-friendly-purple-700 dark:text-friendly-purple-300 font-semibold hover:underline"
  >
    Browse Curated Follow Packs
    <svg className="ml-2 w-4 h-4" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
      <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth="2" d="M13 7l5 5m0 0l-5 5m5-5H6" />
    </svg>
  </a>

## DM Etiquette (2 minutes)

### Safety First

**Nostr DMs are encrypted but not perfect:**

- End-to-end encrypted (E2EE)
- But metadata visible (who talks to whom)
- Some clients handle encryption differently

### DM Best Practices

**Do:**

- Be respectful
- Introduce yourself
- Keep it relevant
- Respect boundaries
- Remember it's still public metadata

**Don't:**

- Spam or harass
- Send unsolicited messages
- Share private keys (EVER)
- Assume complete privacy
- Send sensitive info

### Handling Unwanted DMs

**If someone bothers you:**

1. **Mute** - Stop seeing their content
2. **Block** - They can't interact with you
3. **Report** - If serious, tell community
4. **Don't engage** - Feeds trolls

**Prevention:**

- Don't post your DMs are open if you don't mean it
- Be selective about who you respond to
- Trust your instincts
