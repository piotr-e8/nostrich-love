### The Problem (1 minute read)

**You don't own your social media presence.**

When you build a following on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook, you're building on rented land. Here's what that means:

### Platform Risk Is Real

- **Bans happen.** A mistake, a controversial opinion, or a false report can lock you out of years of content and connections
- **Algorithms change.** Your posts might reach 10,000 people one day and 200 the next—with no warning or explanation
- **Your followers aren't yours.** If the platform bans you, you lose access to the audience you spent years building
- **Data lock-in.** Your posts, photos, and messages are trapped in one company's database

### The Core Issue

Big tech companies control:

- Who can speak
- Who can hear you
- What content gets promoted
- Whether you can export your data

**This isn't just inconvenient—it puts your digital identity at risk.**

### The Solution: Protocol vs Platform (2 minutes read)

Nostr solves this by changing one fundamental thing: **It's a protocol, not a platform.**

### Think Email

You probably use email every day without thinking about this magic:

- Someone on Gmail can email someone on Outlook
- You can switch from Yahoo to ProtonMail and keep your address book
- No single company controls all email

**Email is a protocol.** Anyone can build an email app. Everyone can communicate. No one owns the network.

**Nostr works the same way.**

### The Difference Explained

<ProtocolComparison />

**Centralized (Twitter, Facebook):** One company owns everything. They can ban you, change the rules, or shut down entirely.

**Federated (Mastodon):** Many servers that can talk to each other, but each server owner has power over their users.

**Nostr:** No servers own your identity. You hold the keys. You choose where to post. You can switch apps anytime.

### What This Means for You

- **One identity, everywhere.** Your keys work on every Nostr app
- **Your data follows you.** Switch clients? Your posts and followers come too
- **No one can ban you.** They can ignore you, but they can't stop you from posting
- **Many choices.** Use the app with the interface you love

### Key Concepts (2 minutes read)

Don't worry about memorizing everything. You'll learn by doing. But here's the mental model:

### Public Key (npub) = Your Username

<HoverCard
  term="Public Key"
  definition="A long string starting with 'npub1' that identifies you publicly. Safe to share everywhere."
>
  Your public identity on Nostr looks like: `npub1q...9x`
</HoverCard>

- Looks like: <code className="break-all text-sm">npub1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq</code>
- Share this freely—it's how people find and follow you
- Think of it like your email address or phone number
- **Green light: Safe to share anywhere**

### Private Key (nsec) = Your Password

<HoverCard
  term="Private Key"
  definition="A secret string starting with 'nsec1' that proves you're you. NEVER share this. Lose it = lose your account."
>
  Your secret key looks like: `nsec1q...9x`
</HoverCard>

- Looks like: <code className="break-all text-sm">nsec1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq</code>
- This proves you own your public key
- **RED ALERT: Never share this with anyone**
- Lose it = permanent loss. No "forgot password" option

### Relays = Post Offices

<HoverCard
  term="Relays"
  definition="Servers that store and forward Nostr messages. You choose which ones to connect to, and can switch anytime."
>
  Relays are like post offices for your posts
</HoverCard>

- Servers that store and share Nostr messages
- You choose which ones to use (and can use many)
- Some are free, some require payment
- [ADVANCED] You can even run your own

### Clients = Apps

<HoverCard
  term="Clients"
  definition="The apps you use to interact with Nostr—like Damus, Amethyst, or Iris. You can switch clients anytime without losing your identity."
>
  Clients are like Gmail vs Apple Mail—different interfaces, same protocol
</HoverCard>

- The app you use to post, browse, and message
- Examples: Damus (iOS), Amethyst (Android), Iris (web)
- Switch anytime—you're never locked in

### Why This Matters (1 minute read)

### The Good

✅ **No one can ban you.** They can ignore your posts, but they can't stop you from publishing

✅ **Your data is portable.** Every post, every follower, every like—it's all yours to move

✅ **No ads or algorithms.** Most clients show chronological feeds. Your attention isn't the product

✅ **Resilient.** If one relay goes down, your identity survives. If one client shuts down, you switch to another

### The Responsibility

⚠️ **You are responsible for your keys.** Lose your nsec = lose your identity forever. No help desk to call

⚠️ **No "undo" button.** Deleted posts can persist on relays. Think before you post

⚠️ **Learning curve.** It's new, it's different, and some parts are still rough around the edges

### Is It Worth It?

That depends on what you value:

- **If you want simplicity:** Traditional platforms are easier (for now)
- **If you want freedom:** Nostr gives you control no platform can match
- **If you're curious:** The best way to learn is to try
