Relays are the post offices of Nostr. They're where your messages live and how they travel to reach other users.

## The Post Office Analogy 🏤

Imagine Nostr as a network of post offices around the world.

- **You** have a mailbox (your keys)
- **Relays** are post offices
- **Posts** are letters you send

Here's the key difference from traditional social media: **You choose where to send your mail.**

```
Traditional Social Media:    Nostr:
┌──────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐
│ One Big Server   │        │ Many Post Offices│
│ (Twitter/X)      │        │ (Relays)         │
│                  │        │                  │
│ Everyone in      │        │ You pick which   │
│ one place        │        │ ones to use      │
└──────────────────┘        └──────────────────┘
```

### The Power of Choice

In Nostr, you're not locked into one service provider. You can:

- Send posts to any relay
- Connect to multiple relays
- Switch relays anytime
- Run your own relay

## Why Posts Don't Sync 🔄

Here's the most common confusion new users face:

> "I posted something but my friend can't see it!"

### The Visual Explanation

```
Your Connection                    Friend's Connection
     │                                  │
     ▼                                  ▼
┌──────────┐                     ┌──────────┐
│ Relay A  │         ❌          │ Relay B  │
│ (wss://...)│      No link      │(wss://...)│
└──────────┘                     └──────────┘
     │                                  │
   Your posts                         Friend's posts
```

**If you post to Relay A and your friend only uses Relay B, they won't see your post.**

### The Solution: Connect to Multiple Relays

```
Your Connection
     │
┌────┴────┐
│ Relay A │
│ Relay B │  ← Connect to both!
│ Relay C │
└────┬────┘
     │
   Your posts → Reach more people
```

Most Nostr clients connect you to several default relays. But understanding this helps when you:

- Can't see someone's content
- Want to join a specific community
- Need to troubleshoot missing posts

## Choosing Relays 🔌

### Default Recommendations

If you're just starting, stick with these popular, reliable relays:

| Relay                      | Description      | Reliability |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| `wss://relay.damus.io`     | Damus main relay | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  |
| `wss://nostr.wine`         | General relay    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    |
| `wss://relay.snort.social` | Snort social     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    |

### Interest-Based Discovery

Communities often run their own relays for focused discussions:

- **Bitcoin**: `wss://nostr.bitcoiner.social`
- **Development**: `wss://relay.nostrdevs.com`
- **Art**: `wss://relay.nostrich.art`

<RelayExplorer client:load />

### Free vs Paid Relays

**Free Relays**

- Open to everyone
- May have rate limits
- Can fill up with spam
- Great for beginners

**Paid Relays**

- Usually require small fee (often 1000-5000 sats/month)
- Better performance
- Less spam
- Support relay operators

> 💡 **Tip**: Start with free relays. You can always add paid ones later.

## Advanced: Outbox Model (NIP-65) [ADVANCED]

<Note type="advanced">
  This section is optional. You can use Nostr perfectly well without
  understanding NIP-65.
</Note>

### What is NIP-65?

NIP-65 introduces a smarter way to handle relays called the "outbox model."

**Instead of**: You manually connecting to 10+ relays
**You do**: Publish your preferred relay list once, let clients figure it out

### How It Works

```
1. You publish a relay list:
   {
     "read": ["wss://relay-a.com"],
     "write": ["wss://relay-b.com"]
   }

2. Other clients read this and know:
   - Where to find your posts (read relays)
   - Where to send you messages (write relays)
```

### Setting Up Personal Relays

For advanced users, running your own relay gives you:

- **Complete control** over your data
- **Perfect reliability** (no dependency on others)
- **Privacy** (only your data on the relay)

Popular personal relay software:

- [strfry](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry) - Fast C++ implementation
- [nostr-rs-relay](https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/nostr-rs-relay) - Rust implementation

> 📚 See our [Relay Guide](/guides/relay-guide) for detailed setup instructions.

## Quick Reference

### Common Relay Commands

In most clients, you can:

- **Add relay**: Settings → Relays → Add
- **Remove relay**: Long press/click relay → Remove
- **Check status**: Relay list shows connection status

### Best Practices

1. **Connect to 4-8 relays** for good coverage
2. **Include one "write" relay** where you always post
3. **Check relay uptime** before relying on it
4. **Keep your relay list updated** as the network grows

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see any posts"

- Check if you're connected to any relays (Settings → Relays)
- Try adding popular relays from the list above
- Wait a moment for content to load

### "My posts disappear"

- Some relays delete old content to save space
- Connect to more relays for redundancy
- Consider a paid relay for permanent storage

### "Relay won't connect"

- Check your internet connection
- Try the relay URL in a browser (should show error/ws page)
- The relay might be down - try another one
