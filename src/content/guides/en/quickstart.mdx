## Step 1: Generate Your Keys (1 min)

Your keys are your identity on Nostr. Generate them right here — they're **real** and you can use them on actual clients.

<QuickstartSimulator mode="keygen" client:load />

**What you just created:**
- `npub...` = your public username (safe to share)
- `nsec...` = your private password (NEVER share with anyone)

**Important:** Back up your `nsec` in 3+ places. Lose it = lose your account forever.

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Client

Nostr isn't one app — it's a protocol with **dozens of clients**. Think of it like email: Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail all access the same email system. Your keys work everywhere.

### A. Experience It First

Don't pick blindly. Click a client below to experience how it feels:

<QuickstartSimulator mode="client-picker" client:load />

**What to look for:**
- **Interface** — Do you like the layout and colors?
- **Speed** — How fast do posts load?
- **Features** — Can you easily find what you need?
- **Vibe** — Does it feel right for your style?

**Try at least 2 different clients** to compare.

### B. Compare Features Side-by-Side

Liked one from above? See how it compares to all alternatives:

<ClientComparisonTable client:load />

### C. Pick by Platform

**Quick picks by your device:**

| Platform | Best for Beginners | Best for Power Users |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **iPhone/iPad** | Damus | Current, Nostur |
| **Android** | Amethyst, Primal | Amethyst |
| **Web/Desktop** | Primal, Iris | Coracle |

## Step 3: Simulate Your First Day (2 min)

Now let's practice a typical first day on Nostr:

<QuickstartSimulator mode="first-day" client:load />

**You'll practice:**

1. **Connect to relays** — Join the network by connecting to servers that share posts
2. **Make your first post** — Say hello to the Nostr world
3. **Follow accounts** — Build your feed with interesting people
4. **React to posts** — Join conversations with likes and replies
5. **Receive a zap** — Experience Bitcoin tips (Lightning Network)

**This is exactly what you'll do on real Nostr** — but with zero risk.

## You're Ready to Launch

### What Syncs Automatically

Your keys work on every client. When you switch:

✅ **Your posts** — Stored on relays, available everywhere  
✅ **Your followers** — Follow list is public  
✅ **Your following** — Same as above  
✅ **Your profile** — Name, bio, picture, NIP-05  
✅ **Your relays** — Via NIP-65 relay list

### What Doesn't Sync

❌ **App settings** — Each client has its own preferences  
❌ **Drafts** — Stored locally in each app  
❌ **Muted accounts** — May vary by client  
❌ **Custom lists** — Client-specific features

### How to Switch Clients Later

1. **Export your key** from current client (nsec)
2. **Download new client** or open web app
3. **Import your key** using nsec
4. **Wait for sync** — Follows and profile load automatically
5. **Adjust settings** to your preference

> ⚠️ **Security**: Only paste your nsec into clients you trust. When in doubt, use a signer app like Amber or Nos2x.

## Common Questions

**"Can I use the keys I generated here on real Nostr?"**
Yes! They're real keys. Save them safely.

**"What if I mess up?"**
In simulation? No consequences. On real Nostr? Keys are permanent, but you can always create new ones.

**"Do I need Bitcoin to start?"**
No. Nostr is free. Zaps (tips) are optional.

**"What if I don't like my first client?"**
Switch! Your identity (keys) works on every client. Your followers come with you.

**"Should I use multiple clients?"**
Many users do! One for mobile, one for desktop, one for specific features.
