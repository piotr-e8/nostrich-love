## Why Multiple Clients? (2 minutes)

### The Power of Choice

Nostr's superpower is that your identity works everywhere. Smart users take advantage of this by using multiple clients for different purposes.

### Common Use Cases

**Mobile + Desktop:**

- **Phone (Damus/Amethyst):** Quick checks, on-the-go posting, notifications
- **Desktop (Iris/Snort):** Long-form writing, heavy browsing, work hours

**Public + Private:**

- **Public client:** Professional identity, public posts
- **Private client:** Personal identity, different circles

**Different Features:**

- **Client A:** Great for media
- **Client B:** Better for DMs
- **Client C:** Best for discovery

**Backup & Redundancy:**

- If one client breaks, you have alternatives
- Test new features safely
- Compare interfaces

### Benefits

✅ **Optimization**

- Use best tool for each task
- Different UIs for different contexts
- Feature-specific advantages

✅ **Flexibility**

- Not locked into one interface
- Easy to switch if issues arise
- Experiment freely

✅ **Productivity**

- Desktop for writing
- Mobile for consuming
- Separate contexts = better focus

<Callout type="info">
  **You don't need multiple clients.** But if you're serious about Nostr, it
  unlocks new workflows.

## Syncing Strategy (3 minutes)

### What Syncs Automatically

**Universal (works across all clients):**

- ✓ Your identity (npub)
- ✓ Posts you publish
- ✓ Follows list
- ✓ Profile information
- ✓ Reactions (likes, reposts)
- ✓ DMs (if properly encrypted)

### What Doesn't Sync

**Client-specific:**

- ✗ App settings (themes, fonts)
- ✗ Notification preferences
- ✗ Mute/block lists (sometimes)
- ✗ Draft posts
- ✗ Local bookmarks
- ✗ Custom feeds/algorithms
- ✗ App-specific data

### The Syncing Process

**How it works:**

1. You post from Client A
2. Client A sends to relays
3. Client B connects to same relays
4. Client B sees your post
5. Everything stays in sync

**Time delay:**

- Usually instant to a few seconds
- Depends on relay speed
- Client refresh rate varies

### Workarounds for Non-Syncing Data

**Settings:**

- Manually configure each client
- Document your preferences
- Use similar settings for consistency

**Mutes/Blocks:**

- Some clients export/import lists
- NIP-51 standardizing this
- May need manual sync for now

**Drafts:**

- Use external notes app
- Copy-paste between clients
- Or just post immediately

**Bookmarks:**

- Use NIP-51 lists (if supported)
- External bookmarking tools
- Nostr-based bookmarking services

<Callout type="tip">
  **Pro tip:** Focus on what syncs (content, follows) and don't worry too much
  about what doesn't (settings).
</Callout>

## Desktop + Mobile (3 minutes)

### Recommended Pairings

**iOS User:**

- **Mobile:** Damus (clean, fast)
- **Desktop:** Iris (web) or Snort (web)
- **Why:** Damus is iOS-optimized, web clients work everywhere

**Android User:**

- **Mobile:** Amethyst (feature-rich)
- **Desktop:** Iris (web) or Coracle (web)
- **Why:** Amethyst is Android's best, pair with fast web clients

**Cross-Platform:**

- **Mobile:** Primal (iOS + Android)
- **Desktop:** Same Primal account (web)
- **Why:** Unified experience across devices

### Workflow Examples

**Content Creator:**

- **Draft on desktop** (Iris) - Write, edit, format
- **Post from desktop** - Hit publish
- **Check engagement on mobile** (Damus) - Replies, zaps
- **Quick replies on mobile** - While out and about

**Community Manager:**

- **Monitor on mobile** (Amethyst) - Notifications, alerts
- **Deep engagement on desktop** (Snort) - Long replies, threads
- **DMs on mobile** - Quick conversations
- **Event planning on desktop** - Detailed posts

**Casual User:**

- **Browse on mobile** (any) - During downtime
- **Post from either** - Whatever's convenient
- **No strict workflow** - Just use what feels right

### Keeping Track

**Notifications:**

- Enable on mobile for urgent stuff
- Disable on desktop if distracting
- Or enable both, mute strategically

**Read State:**

- Nostr doesn't track "read" status
- Your client does locally
- May see same posts as "new" on different clients
- This is normal, not a bug

## Backup & Migration (2 minutes)

### Moving Between Clients

**Easy (automatic):**

1. Install new client
2. Import your nsec
3. Wait for sync (follows, profile)
4. Start using

**What transfers:**

- Identity
- Follows list
- Profile info
- Published posts

**What doesn't:**

- Settings
- Drafts
- Local data

### Export/Import When Available

**Some clients support:**

- Follow lists export (NIP-02)
- Mute lists export (NIP-51)
- Settings export (proprietary)

**How to:**

1. Go to Settings → Export
2. Save file
3. Import in new client
4. Verify data transferred

### Testing New Clients

**Safe approach:**

1. Create test keys first
2. Try client with test account
3. If you like it, import real keys
4. Keep old client as backup

**Don't:**

- Import nsec into sketchy clients
- Test with your main identity
- Rush the migration
