## Problem: "My Feed is Empty" 📭

### Symptoms

- No posts showing up
- "No events found" message
- Blank timeline

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Not following anyone**

- **Cause**: New account with no follows
- **Solution**: Search for users or interests, follow 10-20 accounts
- **Quick fix**: Follow popular accounts from the [Finding Community](/guides/finding-community) guide

**2. Relay connection issues**

- **Cause**: Not connected to any relays
- **Solution**: Check Settings → Relays, ensure you're connected to 3-5 relays
- **Quick fix**: Add popular relays: `wss://relay.damus.io`, `wss://nostr.wine`

**3. Client cache is empty**

- **Cause**: New install or cleared data
- **Solution**: Wait 30-60 seconds for content to load
- **Quick fix**: Pull down to refresh (mobile) or press refresh button

### Prevention

## Problem: "I Can't See My Old Posts" 🕐

### Symptoms

- Posts from yesterday/week ago are missing
- "No notes" on your profile
- Incomplete post history

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Relay storage limits**

- **Cause**: Free relays delete old content to save space
- **Solution**: Connect to more relays (increases redundancy)
- **Long-term**: Use paid relays or personal relay for important content

**2. Different relay configuration**

- **Cause**: Posted from Client A (Relays X,Y), now using Client B (Relays Z)
- **Solution**: Ensure both clients use the same relays
- **Quick fix**: Import your relay list (NIP-65)

**3. Content not broadcasted**

- **Cause**: Client failed to post to all relays
- **Solution**: Check which relays received your post
- **Note**: Once posted, can't re-broadcast to new relays retroactively

### What Syncs vs What Doesn't

| Data           | Syncs Across Clients | Notes                      |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Your posts     | ✅ Yes               | If posted to shared relays |
| Your follows   | ✅ Yes               | Public data                |
| Your followers | ✅ Yes               | Public data                |
| Your profile   | ✅ Yes               | Public data                |
| Drafts         | ❌ No                | Stored locally per client  |
| App settings   | ❌ No                | Client-specific            |
| Muted accounts | ⚠️ Sometimes         | Varies by client           |

## Problem: "My Posts Aren't Showing Up" 📤

### Symptoms

- Posted but no one sees it
- No likes/replies/zaps
- Post appears locally but not on other clients

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Relay not accepting posts**

- **Cause**: Rate limited, banned, or relay down
- **Solution**: Check relay status, try different relays
- **Test**: Can you see your post in a web client like Primal?

**2. Only connected to read-only relays**

- **Cause**: Some relays only allow reading, not writing
- **Solution**: Check relay settings, ensure you have "write" relays
- **Quick fix**: Add `wss://relay.damus.io` (allows writing)

**3. Posting too fast**

- **Cause**: Hitting rate limits
- **Solution**: Slow down, wait a few minutes
- **Note**: Most relays limit to 1-5 posts per second

## Problem: "Someone is Impersonating Me" 🎭

### Symptoms

- Fake account with your name/picture
- Someone claiming to be you
- Confused followers asking which account is real

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Get NIP-05 verified**

- **Solution**: Set up NIP-05 identity (see [guide](/guides/nip05-identity))
- **Why**: Verified badge distinguishes real from fake

**2. Share your npub widely**

- **Solution**: Post your real npub on other platforms
- **Why**: People can verify your identity cryptographically

**3. Report the impostor**

- **Solution**: Use client report feature or community moderation
- **Note**: Can't delete their account (decentralized), but can block/mute

### Prevention

- Verify yourself with NIP-05 as soon as possible
- Post your npub on Twitter/website
- Build reputation quickly so your real account is obvious

## Problem: "Spam in My Feed" 🗑️

### Symptoms

- Unwanted promotional content
- Bot accounts posting constantly
- Off-topic or inappropriate content

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Following spam accounts**

- **Solution**: Unfollow spam sources
- **Better**: Don't mass-follow; curate carefully

**2. Relay with poor moderation**

- **Solution**: Disconnect from low-quality relays
- **Better**: Use paid or invite-only relays

**3. No mute list**

- **Solution**: Create a mute list in your client
- **How**: Profile → Muted accounts → Add spammers

### Best Practices

- Mute early, mute often
- Use interest-specific relays
- Enable word filters if client supports it
- Don't follow accounts without checking their content first

---

## Problem: "Client Crashes" 💥

### Symptoms

- App closes unexpectedly
- Freezes or becomes unresponsive
- Errors when loading content

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Outdated app**

- **Solution**: Update to latest version from app store
- **iOS**: App Store → Updates
- **Android**: Play Store → Manage apps

**2. Too many relays**

- **Cause**: Connected to 20+ relays overwhelms the client
- **Solution**: Reduce to 4-8 active relays
- **Optimize**: Use NIP-65 outbox model

**3. Corrupted cache**

- **Solution**: Clear app data (you won't lose posts/follows)
- **Nuclear option**: Reinstall app, re-import keys

### Try a Different Client

If one client consistently has issues, try another:

| Platform           | Alternative          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| iOS (Damus)        | Nos, Nostur          |
| Android (Amethyst) | Primal web, Nostros  |
| Web (Primal)       | Iris, Snort, Coracle |

## Problem: "Lost My Keys" 🔑

### Symptoms

- Can't log in to client
- No backup of nsec/npub
- Keys only on one device that broke

### The Hard Truth

> ⚠️ **If you don't have a backup of your keys, your account is unrecoverable.**

This is by design—Nostr has no "forgot password" because there's no central server holding your keys.

### What You CAN Do

**1. Search for backups**

- Check password managers
- Look for screenshots
- Check email for welcome messages
- Check other devices with client installed

**2. Check if client has keys stored**

- Some clients cache keys
- Try logging in without pasting key
- Check browser extensions (Alby, Nos2x)

**3. Create new account**

- Generate new keys
- Announce on other platforms that old account is lost
- Start rebuilding your follows

### Prevention (Do This NOW)

1. **Write down your nsec** on paper
2. **Store in password manager** (1Password, Bitwarden)
3. **Use a signer app** (Amber, Nos2x) to avoid typing nsec
4. **Make multiple backups** in different locations

## Problem: "Can't Connect to Relay" 🔌

### Symptoms

- "Connection failed" error
- Relay shows as offline
- Posts not syncing

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Relay is down**

- **Test**: Open relay URL in browser (should show error or ws page)
- **Solution**: Check relay's status page or social media
- **Fix**: Remove temporarily, re-add when back

**2. Network issues**

- **Test**: Can you access other websites?
- **Solution**: Check internet connection, try different network
- **Note**: Some networks block WebSocket connections

**3. Wrong relay URL**

- **Check**: Must start with `wss://` (secure) or `ws://` (insecure)
- **Common mistake**: `https://relay.com` instead of `wss://relay.com`
- **Fix**: Edit relay URL in settings

**4. Relay is full**

- **Cause**: Some free relays hit capacity limits
- **Solution**: Try again later or use different relay
- **Long-term**: Consider paid relay

## Problem: "Zaps Not Working" ⚡

### Symptoms

- Zap button unresponsive
- "Payment failed" errors
- Can't send or receive zaps

### Causes & Solutions

**1. No wallet connected**

- **Solution**: Connect Lightning wallet in client settings
- **See**: [Zaps Guide](/guides/zaps-and-lightning)

**2. Insufficient balance**

- **Check**: Wallet balance
- **Solution**: Add funds to your wallet
- **Minimum**: Usually need 100+ sats for fees

**3. Wallet offline**

- **Cause**: Non-custodial wallets need to be online
- **Solution**: Open your wallet app, ensure it's running
- **Alternative**: Use custodial wallet like Alby

**4. Wrong Lightning address**

- **Check**: Is your Lightning address correct in profile?
- **Test**: Try sending yourself 10 sats
- **Fix**: Update address in profile settings

## Problem: "Images Not Loading" 🖼️

### Symptoms

- Broken image icons
- Spinning loaders
- No media in posts

### Causes & Solutions

**1. Relay media limits**

- **Cause**: Some relays don't store images, only text
- **Solution**: Images hosted on separate servers (Blossom, etc.)
- **Fix**: Check if images load on web client

**2. Image host down**

- **Cause**: The server hosting the image is offline
- **Test**: Try opening image URL directly
- **Note**: Nothing you can do if host is down

**3. Client settings**

- **Check**: Settings → Media → "Load images"
- **Some clients**: Have data-saving modes that block images
- **Fix**: Enable media loading in settings

**4. Slow connection**

- **Cause**: Large images on slow internet
- **Solution**: Wait for load, or switch to faster network
