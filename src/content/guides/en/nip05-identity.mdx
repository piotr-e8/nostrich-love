## What is NIP-05? 🆔

NIP-05 (Nostr Implementation Possibility #5) lets you have a human-readable identifier like `you@domain.com` instead of a long string of random characters.

### The Problem It Solves

```
Before NIP-05:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Follow: npub1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  │
│ "Hey, follow me! I'm npub1abc123...xyz789"   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↓
After NIP-05:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Follow: alice@example.com                    │
│ "Hey, follow me! I'm alice@example.com"      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What You Get

- ✅ **Easy to share**: "Find me at bob@nostrplebs.com"
- ✅ **Looks professional**: Clean, memorable identifier
- ✅ **Trust signal**: NIP-05 badge in many clients
- ✅ **Easier to find**: Search by your identifier

### But Remember...

> ⚠️ **NIP-05 is optional.** You can use Nostr perfectly well with just your npub.

The NIP-05 identifier is a **convenience**, not a requirement. Your `npub` is your real identity on Nostr.

---

## Why Get a NIP-05? ✨

### Easier to Share

```
At a party:
"What's your Nostr?"

Without NIP-05:
"Uh... n-p-u-b-one-x-x-x... let me find it in my phone"

With NIP-05:
"Just alice@example.com"
```

### Professional Appearance

- **Businesses**: `support@yourcompany.com`
- **Creators**: `artist@yourdomain.com`
- **Developers**: `dev@opensourceproject.com`

### Trust & Authenticity

Many clients show a ✓ badge for NIP-05 users:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 👤 Alice ✓          │
│ alice@example.com   │
│ "Bitcoin educator"  │
└─────────────────────┘
```

This helps people know they're following the real you, not an impostor.

### Do You Need One?

**No.** You can use Nostr perfectly fine without it.

**But...** it's highly recommended if you're:

- Building a personal brand
- Creating content
- Running a business
- Serious about Nostr long-term
- Tired of reading 63-character strings

### Not Centralization!

Some worry NIP-05 means "centralized identity." It doesn't:

- You can have **multiple** NIP-05 identifiers
- You can **change** them anytime
- Your **npub** is still your real identity
- NIP-05 is just a **pointer** to your npub

## Using Your Own Domain 🌐

For complete control and professionalism, use your own domain.

### Step 1: Buy a Domain

Any domain registrar works:

- [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com)
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com)
- [Cloudflare Registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/)

Cost: Usually $10-15/year

### Step 2: DNS Setup

Add a DNS record to point to your Nostr key:

**Type:** TXT  
**Name:** `_@` (or just `@` for root)  
**Value:**

```
"nostr": "<your-npub>"
```

Or use a redirect:

**Type:** CNAME  
**Name:** `nostr`  
**Value:** `your-nostr-provider.com`

### Step 3: Create NIP-05 JSON

Host a file at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/nostr.json`:

```json
{
  "names": {
    "alice": "<your-npub-here>",
    "bob": "<another-npub>"
  }
}
```

Your identifier becomes: `alice@yourdomain.com`

### Example Setup Walkthrough

**Scenario:** You own `alice.dev`

1. **Create the JSON file:**

```json
{
  "names": {
    "alice": "npub1abc123..."
  }
}
```

2. **Upload to your server:**

```
https://alice.dev/.well-known/nostr.json
```

3. **Verify it works:**
   Open in browser: `https://alice.dev/.well-known/nostr.json`

4. **Add to your Nostr profile:**
   In your client: Settings → Profile → NIP-05 → `alice@alice.dev`

## Testing Your NIP-05 ✅

### Check Your Identifier

Use our tool below or visit your identifier URL:

<NIP05Checker showForm={true} client:load />

### In Your Client

Most clients show NIP-05 status:

**Damus/Amethyst:**

- Settings → Profile → NIP-05 field
- Shows ✓ when set up correctly

**Primal:**

- Profile shows NIP-05 badge
- Click badge to see details

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"NIP-05 not working"**

- Double-check your npub is correct in nostr.json
- Ensure the JSON is valid (use a JSON validator)
- Check that the file is accessible at the exact URL

**"File not found"**

- Make sure `.well-known` folder is created
- Check your server serves hidden directories
- Verify the path: `/.well-known/nostr.json`

**"Domain not resolving"**

- DNS changes can take up to 24 hours
- Clear your DNS cache
- Check with `dig` or `nslookup` command

**"Client doesn't recognize it"**

- Some clients cache NIP-05 lookup results
- Try logging out and back in
- Wait a few minutes for propagation

**"Verification Failed" Error**

**Possible causes:**

1. **JSON syntax error** - Check for missing quotes or commas
2. **Wrong file location** - Must be at `/.well-known/nostr.json`
3. **Caching** - Wait 10-15 minutes and retry
4. **HTTPS required** - Must be served over HTTPS

**Fix:**

- Validate JSON at jsonlint.com
- Check file is at exact path
- Clear client cache
- Ensure SSL certificate is valid

**"Not Found" Error**

**Possible causes:**

1. File not uploaded to correct location
2. Server blocks dot-directories
3. Wrong domain

**Fix:**

- Verify file exists at exact URL
- Check `.htaccess` or server config allows dot-directories
- Confirm you're using correct domain

**Provider-Specific Issues**

**NostrPlebs:**

- Check spam folder for verification email
- Ensure npub is correct (not nsec!)
- Contact support if stuck

**Self-hosted:**

- Verify DNS propagation: `dig yourdomain.com`
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure file permissions allow reading

<Callout type="warning">
  Never share your nsec (private key) when setting up NIP-05. Only your npub
  (public key) is needed.
</Callout>

## Advanced Tips 💡

### Multiple Identities

You can have multiple NIP-05 addresses:

```
personal@yourdomain.com
work@yourdomain.com
blog@yourdomain.com
```

All point to the same npub, or different ones.

### Subdomains

Use subdomains for organization:

```
alice@team.yourdomain.com
alice@community.yourdomain.com
```

### Hosting Multiple Users

You can host multiple NIP-05 identifiers on one domain:

```json
{
  "names": {
    "alice": "npub1alice...",
    "bob": "npub1bob...",
    "carol": "npub1carol..."
  }
}
```

### Verifying Your Setup

**Method 1: Your Client**

1. Add the NIP-05 to your profile
2. Save changes
3. Look for a checkmark ✓ or "verified" badge
4. May take a few minutes to propagate

**Method 2: Nostr Explorer**

1. Visit a Nostr explorer like nostr.guru
2. Search for your NIP-05
3. Check if it resolves to your npub

**Method 3: Direct Test (Command Line)**

```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/nostr.json
```

**What Success Looks Like:**

- ✅ Client shows verification badge
- ✅ Others can find you by your NIP-05
- ✅ Your profile displays your human-readable name

### Privacy Considerations

- NIP-05 links your npub to a domain
- This could deanonymize you if the domain has your real info
- Use free providers for pseudonymous accounts
- Use your own domain when you want to be identified
